/**
 * Manages a pool of Web Workers, optimizing resource usage by limiting the number of non-busy workers.
 * Provides methods to spawn, reuse, terminate, and clean up workers.
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // 1. Instantiate the manager with the worker script URL
 * const manager = new WorkerManager(new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url));
 *
 * // 2. Get an available worker (or spawn a new one)
 * const worker = manager.getWorker();
 *
 * // 3. Mark the worker busy/free as needed
 * // worker.busy = true; // when starting a task
 * // worker.busy = false; // when done
 *
 * // 4. Terminate a specific worker
 * manager.terminateWorker(worker);
 *
 * // 5. Cleanup all workers when done
 * manager.cleanup();
 * ```
 *
